<p>STANTON DAVIES and Jim Wemple ceased from their talk to listen to an 
increase of uproar in the street. A volley of stones thrummed and boomed 
the wire mosquito nettings that protected the windows. It was a hot night, 
and the sweat of the heat stood on their faces as they listened. Arose the 
incoherent clamor of the mob, punctuated by individual cries in Mexican-
Spanish. Least terrible among the obscene threats were: "Death to the 
Gringos!" "Kill the American pigs!" "Drown the American dogs in the 
sea!"</p>

<p>Stanton Davies and Jim Wemple shrugged their shoulders patiently to 
each other, and resumed their conversation, talking louder in order to 
make themselves heard above the uproar.</p>

<p>"The question is how," Wemple said. "It's forty-seven miles to 
Panuco, by river—"</p>

<p>"And the land's impossible, with Zaragoza's and Villa's men on the 
loot and maybe fraternizing," Davies agreed.</p>

<p>Wemple nodded and continued: "And she's at the East Coast Magnolia, two miles beyond, if she isn't back at the hunting camp. We've 
got to get her—"</p>

<p>"We've played pretty square in this matter, Wemple," Davies said. 
"And we might as well speak up and acknowledge what each of us knows 
the other knows. You want her. I want her."</p>

<p>Wemple lighted a cigarette and nodded.</p>

<p>"And now's the time when it's up to us to make a show as if we didn't 
want her and that all we want is just to save her and get her down 
here."</p>

<p>"And a truce until we do save her—I get you," Wemple 
affirmed.</p>

<p>"A truce until we get her safe and sound back here in Tampico, or 
aboard a battleship. After that . . . ?"</p>

<p>Both men shrugged shoulders and beamed on each other as their 
hands met in ratification.</p>

<p>Fresh volleys of stones thrummed against the wire-screened windows; 
a boy's voice rose shrilly above the clamor, proclaiming death to the 
Gringos; and the house reverberated to the heavy crash of some battering 
ram against the street-door downstairs. Both men, snatching up automatic 
rifles, ran down to where their fire could command the threatened 
door.</p>

<p>"If they break in we've got to let them have it," Wemple said.</p>

<p>Davies nodded quiet agreement, then inconsistently burst out with a 
lurid string of oaths.</p>

<p>"To think of it!" he explained his wrath. "One out of three of those 
curs outside has worked for you or me—lean-bellied, bare-footed, 
poverty-stricken, glad for ten centavos a day if they could only get work. 
And we've given them steady jobs and a hundred and fifty centavos a day, 
and here they are yelling for our blood."</p>

<p>"Only the half breeds;" Davies corrected.</p>

<p>"You know what I mean," Wemple replied. "The only peons we've 
lost are those that have been run off or shot."</p>

<p>The attack on the door ceasing, they returned upstairs. Half a dozen 
scattered shots from farther along the street seemed to draw away the mob, 
for the neighborhood became comparatively quiet.</p>

<p>A whistle came to them through the open windows, and a man's voice 
calling:</p>

<p>"Wemple! Open the door! It's Habert! Want to talk to you!"</p>

<p>Wemple went down, returning in several minutes with a tidily-paunched, well-built, gray-haired American of fifty. He shook hands with 
Davies and flung himself into a chair, breathing heavily. He did not 
relinquish his clutch on the Colt's 44 automatic pistol, although he 
immediately addressed himself to the task of fishing a filled clip of 
cartridges from the pocket of his linen coat. He had arrived hatless and 
breathless, and the blood from a stone-cut on the cheek oozed down his 
face. He, too, in a fit of anger, springing to his feet when he had changed 
clips in his pistol, burst out with mouth-filling profanity.</p>

<p>"They had an American flag in the dirt, stamping and spitting on it. 
And they told me to spit on it."</p>

<p>Wemple and Davies regarded him with silent interrogation.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know what you're wondering!" he flared out. "Would I a-spit 
on it in the pinch? That's what's eating you. I'll answer. Straight out, brass 
tacks, I WOULD. Put that in your pipe and smoke it."</p>

<p>He paused to help himself to a cigar from the box on the table and to 
light it with a steady and defiant hand.</p>

<p>"Hell !—I guess this neck of the woods knows Anthony Habert, 
and you can bank on it that it's never located his yellow streak. Sure, in the 
pinch, I'd spit on Old Glory. What the hell d'ye think I'm going on the 
streets for a night like this? Didn't I skin out of the Southern Hotel half an 
hour ago, where there are forty buck Americans, not counting their 
women, and all armed? That was safety. What d'ye think I came here 
for?—to rescue you?"</p>

<p>His indignation lumped his throat into silence, and he seemed shaken 
as with an apoplexy.</p>

<p>"Spit it out," Davies commanded dryly.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you,' Habert exploded. "It's Billy Boy. Fifty miles up country 
and twenty-thousand throat-cutting federals and rebels between him and 
me. D'ye know what that boy'd do, if he was here in Tampico and I was 
fifty miles up the Panuco? Well, I know. And I'm going to do the 
same—go and get him."</p>

<p>"We're figuring on going up," Wemple assured him.</p>

<p>"And that's why I headed here—Miss Drexel, of course?"</p>

<p>Both men acquiesced and smiled. It was a time when men dared speak 
of matters which at other times tabooed speech.</p>

<p>"Then the thing's to get started," Habert exclaimed, looking at his 
watch. "It's midnight now. We've got to get to the river and get a 
boat— "</p>

<p>But the clamor of the returning mob came through the windows in 
answer.</p>

<p>Davies was about to speak, when the telephone rang, and Wemple 
sprang to the instrument.</p>

<p>"It's Carson," he interjected, as he listened. "They haven't cut the wires 
across the river yet.—Hello, Carson. Was it a break or a cut? . . . 
Bully for you. . . . Yes, move the mules across to the potrero beyond 
Tamcochin . . . . Who's at the water station? . . . Can you still 'phone him? 
. . . Tell him to keep the tanks full, and to shut off the main to Arico. Also, 
to hang on till the last minute, and keep a horse saddled to cut and run for 
it. Last thing before he runs, he must jerk out the 'phone . . . . Yes, yes, 
yes. Sure. No breeds. Leave full-blooded Indians in charge. Gabriel is a 
good <em>hombre.</em> Heaven knows, once we're chased out, when we'll 
get back . . . . You can't pinch down Jaramillo under twenty-five hundred 
barrels. We've got storage for ten days. Gabriel'll have to handle it. Keep it 
moving, if we have to run it into the river—"</p>

<p>"Ask him if he has a launch," Habert broke in.</p>

<p>"He hasn't," was Wemple's answer. "The federals commandeered the 
last one at noon."</p>

<p>"Say, Carson, how are you going to make your get-away?" Wemple 
queried.</p>

<p>The man to whom he talked was across the Panuco, on the south side, 
at the tank farm.</p>

<p>"Says there isn't any get-away," Wemple vouchsafed to the other two. 
"The federals are all over the shop, and he can't understand why they 
haven't raided him hours ago."</p>

<p>". . . Who? Campos? That skunk! . . . all right . . . Don't be worried if 
you don't hear from me. I'm going up river with Davies and Habert . . . . 
Use your judgment, and if you get a safe chance at Campos, pot him . . . . 
Oh, a hot time over here. They're battering our doors now. Yes, by all 
means . . . Good-by, old man."</p>

<p>Wemple lighted a cigarette and wiped his forehead.</p>

<p>"You know Campos, Jose H. Campos," he volunteered. "The dirty 
cur's stuck Carson up for twenty thousand pesos. We had to pay, or he'd 
have compelled half our peons to enlist or set the wells on fire. And you 
know, Davies, what we've done for him in past years. Gratitude? Simple 
decency? Great Scott!"</p>


<p>It was the night of April twenty-first. On the morning of the twenty-
first the American marines and bluejackets had landed at Vera Cruz and 
seized the custom house and the city. Immediately the news was 
telegraphed, the vengeful Mexican mob had taken possession of the streets 
of Tampico and expressed its disapproval of the action of the United 
States by tearing down American flags and crying death to the 
Americans.</p>

<p>There was nothing save its own spinelessness to deter the mob from 
carrying out its threat. Had it battered down the doors of the Southern 
Hotel, or of other hotels, or of residences such as Wemple's, a fight would 
have started in which the thousands of federal soldiers in Tampico would 
have joined their civilian compatriots in the laudable task of decreasing 
the Gringo population of that particular portion of Mexico. There should 
have been American warships to act as deterrents; but through some 
inexplicable excess of delicacy, or strategy, or heaven knows what, the 
United States, when it gave its orders to take Vera Cruz, had very 
carefully withdrawn its warships from Tampico to the open Gulf a dozen 
miles away. This order had come to Admiral Mayo by wireless from 
Washington, and thrice he had demanded the order to be repeated, ere, 
with tears in his eyes, he had turned his back on his countrymen and 
countrywomen and steamed to sea.</p>


<p>"Of all asinine things, to leave us in the lurch this way!" Habert was 
denouncing the powers that be of his country. "Mayo'd never have done it. 
Mark my words, he had to take program from Washington. And here we 
are, and our dear ones scattered for fifty miles back up country . . . . Say, if I lose Billy Boy I'll never dare go home to face the wife.—Come on. 
Let the three of us make a start. We can throw the fear of God into any 
gang on the streets."</p>

<p>"Come on over and take a squint," Davies invited from where he 
stood, somewhat back from the window, looking down into the street.</p>

<p>It was gorged with rioters, all haranguing, cursing, crying out death, 
and urging one another to smash the doors, but each hanging back from 
the death he knew waited behind those doors for the first of the rush.</p>

<p>"We can't break through a bunch like that, Habert," was Davies' 
comment.</p>

<p>"And if we die under their feet we'll be of little use to Billy Boy or 
anybody else up the Panuco," Wemple added. "And if—"</p>

<p>A new movement of the mob caused him to break off. It was splitting 
before a slow and silent advance of a file of white-clad men.</p>

<p>"Bluejackets—Mayo's come back for us after all," Habert 
muttered.</p>

<p>"Then we can get a navy launch," Davies said.</p>

<p>The bedlam of the mob died away, and, in silence, the sailors reached 
the street door and knocked for admittance. All three went down to open 
it, and to discover that the callers were not Americans but two German 
lieutenants and half a dozen German marines. At sight of the Americans, 
the rage of the mob rose again, and was quelled by the grounding of the 
rifle butts of the marines.</p>

<p>"No, thank you;" the senior lieutenant, in passable English, declined 
the invitation to enter. He unconcernedly kept his cigar alive at such times 
that the mob drowned his voice. "We are on the way back to our ship. Our 
commander conferred with the English and Dutch commanders; but they 
declined to cooperate, so our commander has undertaken the entire 
responsibility. We have been the round of the hotels. They are to hold 
their own until daybreak, when we'll take them off. We have given them 
rockets such as these.—Take them. If your house is entered, hold 
your own and send up a rocket from the roof. We can be here in force, in 
forty-five minutes. Steam is up in all our launches, launch crews and 
marines for shore duty are in the launches, and at the first rocket we shall 
start."</p>

<p>"Since you are going aboard now, we should like to go with you," 
Davies said, after having rendered due thanks.</p>

<p>The surprise and distaste on both lieutenants' faces was patent.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," Davies laughed. "We don't want refuge. We have friends 
fifty miles up river, and we want to get to the river in order to go up after 
them."</p>

<p>The pleasure on the officers' faces was immediate as they looked a 
silent conference at each other.</p>

<p>"Since our commander has undertaken grave responsibility on a night 
like this, may we do less than take minor responsibility?" queried the 
elder.</p>

<p>To this the younger heartily agreed. In a trice, upstairs and down 
again, equipped with extra ammunition, extra pistols, and a pocket-bulging 
supply of cigars, cigarettes and matches, the three Americans were ready. 
Wemple called last instructions up the stairway to imaginary occupants 
being left behind, ascertained that the spring lock was on, and slammed 
the door.</p>

<p>The officers led, followed by the Americans, the rear brought up by 
the six marines; and the spitting, howling mob, not daring to cast a stone, 
gave way before them.</p>

<p>As they came alongside the gangway of the cruiser, they saw launches 
and barges lying in strings to the boat-booms, filled with men, waiting for 
the rocket signal from the beleaguered hotels. A gun thundered from close 
at hand, up river, followed by the thunder of numerous guns and the 
reports of many rifles fired very rapidly.</p>

<p>"Now what's the <em>Topila</em> whanging away at?" Habert 
complained, then joined the others in gazing at the picture.</p>

<p>A searchlight, evidently emanating from the Mexican gunboat, was 
stabbing the darkness to the middle of the river, where it played upon the 
water. And across the water, the center of the moving circle of light, 
flashed a long, lean speedboat. A shell burst in the air a hundred feet 
astern of it. Somewhere, outside the light, other shells were bursting in the 
water; for they saw the boat rocked by the waves from the explosions. 
They could guess the whizzing of the rifle bullets.</p>

<p>But for only several minutes the spectacle lasted. Such was the speed 
of the boat that it gained shelter behind the German, when the Mexican 
gunboat was compelled to cease fire. The speedboat slowed down, turned 
in a wide and heeling circle, and ranged up alongside the launch at the 
gangway.</p>

<p>The lights from the gangway showed but one occupant, a tow-headed, 
greasy-faced, blond youth of twenty, very lean, very calm, very much 
satisfied with himself.</p>

<p>"If it ain't Peter Tonsburg!" Habert ejaculated, reaching out a hand to 
shake. "Howdy, Peter, howdy. And where in hell are you hell-bent for, 
surging by the <em>Topila</em> in such scandalous fashion?"</p>

<p>Peter, a Texas-born Swede of immigrant parents, filled with the old 
Texas traditions, greasily shook hands with Wemple and Davies as well, 
saying "Howdy," as only the Texan born can say it.</p>

<p>"Me," he answered Habert. "I ain't hell-bent nowhere exceptin' to get 
away from the shell-fire. She's a caution, that <em>Topila.</em> Huh! but I 
limbered 'em up some. I was goin' every inch of twenty-five. They was 
like amateurs blazin' away at canvasback."</p>

<p>"Which <em>Chill</em> is it?" Wemple asked.</p>

<p><em>"Chill II,"</em> Peter answered. "It's all that's left. <em>Chill I </em>a 
Greaser—you know 'm—Campos—commandeered this 
noon. I was runnin' <em>Chill III</em> when they caught me at sundown. 
Made me come in under their guns at the East Coast outfit, and fired me 
out on my neck.</p>

<p>"Now the boss'd gone over in this one to Tampico in the early evening, 
and just about ten minutes ago I spots it landin' with a sousy bunch of 
Federals at the East Coast, and swipes it back according. Where's the 
boss? He ain't hurt, is he? Because I'm going after him."</p>

<p>"No, you're not, Peter," Davies said. "Mr. Frisbie is safe at the 
Southern Hotel, all except a five-inch scalp wound from a brick that's got 
him down with a splitting headache. He's safe, so you're going with us, 
going to take us, I mean, up beyond Panuco town."</p>

<p>"Huh?—I can see myself," Peter retorted, wiping his greasy nose 
on a wad of greasy cotton waste. "I got some cold. Besides, this night-
drivin' ain't good for my complexion."</p>

<p>"My boy's up there," Habert said.</p>

<p>"Well, he's bigger'n I am, and I reckon he can take care of 
himself."</p>

<p>"And there's a woman there—Miss Drexel," Davies said 
quietly.</p>

<p>"Who? Miss Drexel? Why didn't you say so at first?" Peter demanded 
grievedly. He sighed and added, "Well, climb in an' make a start. Better 
get your Dutch friends to donate me about twenty gallons of gasoline if 
you want to get anywhere."</p>


<p>"Won't do you no good to lay low," Peter Tonsburg remarked, as, at 
full speed, headed up river, the <em>Topila's</em> searchlight stabbed them. 
"High or low, if one of them shells hits in the vicinity—good 
night!"</p>

<p>Immediately thereafter the <em>Topila</em> erupted. The roar of the 
<em>Chill's</em> exhaust nearly drowned the roar of the guns, but the fragile 
hull of the craft was shaken and rocked by the bursting shells. An 
occasional bullet thudded into or pinged off the <em>Chill,</em> and, despite 
Peter's warning that, high or low, they were bound to get it if it came to 
them, every man on board, including Peter, crouched, with chest 
contracted by drawn-in shoulders, in an instinctive and purely unconscious 
effort to lessen the area of body he presented as a target or receptacle for 
flying fragments of steel.</p>

<p>The <em>Topila</em> was a federal gunboat. To complicate the affair, 
the constitutionalists, gathered on the north shore in the siege of Tampico, 
opened up on the speedboat with many rifles and a machine gun.</p>

<p>"Lord, I'm glad they're Mexicans, and not Americans," Habert 
observed, after five mad minutes in which no damage had been received. 
"Mexicans are born with guns in their hands, and they never learn to use 
them."</p>

<p>Nor was the <em>Chill</em> or any man aboard damaged when at last 
she rounded the bend of river that shielded her from the searchlight.</p>

<p>"I'll have you in Panuco town in less'n three hours, . . . if we don't hit a 
log," Peter leaned back and shouted in Wemple's ear. "And if we do hit 
driftwood, I'll have you in the swim quicker than that."</p>

<p><em>Chill II</em> tore her way through the darkness, steered by the tow-
headed youth who knew every foot of the river and who guided his course 
by the loom of the banks in the dim starlight. A smart breeze, kicking up 
spiteful wavelets on the wider reaches, splashed them with sheeted water 
as well as fine-flung spray. And, in the face of the warmth of the tropic 
night, the wind, added to the speed of the boat, chilled them through their 
wet clothes.</p>

<p>"Now I know why she was named the <em>Chill,"</em> Habert observed 
betwixt chattering teeth.</p>

<p>But conversation languished during the nearly three hours of drive 
through the darkness. Once, by the exhaust, they knew that they passed an 
unlighted launch bound down stream. And once, a glare of light, near the 
south bank, as they passed through the Toreno field, aroused brief debate 
as to whether it was the Toreno wells, or the bungalow on Merrick's 
banana plantation that flared so fiercely.</p>

<p>At the end of an hour, Peter slowed down and ran in to the bank.</p>

<p>"I got a cache of gasoline here—ten gallons," he explained, "and 
it's just as well to know it's here for the back trip." Without leaving the 
boat, fishing arm-deep into the brush, he announced, "All hunky-dory." He 
proceeded to oil the engine. "Huh!" he soliloquized for their benefit. "I 
was just readin' a magazine yarn last night. 'Whose Business Is to Die,' 
was its title. An' all I got to say is, 'The hell it is.' A man's business is to 
live. Maybe you thought it was our business to die when the 
<em>Topila</em> was pepperin' us. But you was wrong. We're alive, ain't 
we? We beat her to it. That's the game. Nobody's got any business to die. I 
ain't never goin' to die, if I've got any say about it."</p>

<p>He turned over the crank, and the roar and rush of the <em>Chill</em> 
put an end to speech.</p>

<p>There was no need for Wemple or Davies to speak further in the affair 
closest to their hearts. Their truce to love-making had been made as 
binding as it was brief, and each rival honored the other with a firm belief 
that he would commit no infraction of the truce. Afterward was another 
matter. In the meantime they were one in the effort to get Beth Drexel 
back to the safety of riotous Tampico or of a war vessel.</p>

<p>It was four o'clock when they passed by Panuco Town. Shouts and 
songs told them that the federal detachment holding the place was 
celebrating its indignation at the landing of American bluejackets in Vera 
Cruz. Sentinels challenged the <em>Chill</em> from the shore and shot at 
random at the noise of her in the darkness.</p>

<p>A mile beyond, where a lighted river steamer with steam up lay at the 
north bank, they ran in at the Apshodel wells. The steamer was small, and 
the nearly two hundred Americans—men, women, and 
children—crowded her capacity. Blasphemous greetings of pure joy 
and geniality were exchanged between the men, and Habert learned that 
the steamboat was waiting for his Billy Boy, who, astride a horse, was 
rounding up isolated drilling gangs who had not yet learned that the 
United States had seized Vera Cruz and that all Mexico was boiling.</p>

<p>Habert climbed out to wait and to go down on the steamer, while the 
three that remained on the <em>Chill,</em> having learned that Miss Drexel 
was not with the refugees, headed for the Dutch Company on the south 
shore. This was the big gusher, pinched down from one hundred and 
eighty-five thousand daily barrels to the quantity the company was able to 
handle. Mexico had no quarrel with Holland, so that the superintendent, 
while up, with night guards out to prevent drunken soldiers from firing his 
vast lakes of oil, was quite unemotional. Yes, the last he had heard was 
that Miss Drexel and her brother were back at the hunting lodge. No; he 
had not sent any warnings, and he doubted that anybody else had. Not till 
ten o'clock the previous evening had he learned of the landing at Vera 
Cruz. The Mexicans had turned nasty as soon as they heard of it, and they 
had killed Miles Forman at the Empire Wells, run off his labor, and looted 
the camp. Horses? No; he didn't have horse or mule on the place. The 
federals had commandeered the last animal weeks back. It was his belief, 
however, that there were a couple of plugs at the lodge, too worthless even 
for the Mexicans to take.</p>

<p>"It's a hike," Davies said cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Six miles of it," Wemple agreed, equally cheerfully. "Let's beat 
it."</p>

<p>A shot from the river, where they had left Peter in the boat, started 
them on the run for the bank. A scattering of shots, as from two rifles, 
followed. And while the Dutch superintendent, in execrable Spanish, 
shouted affirmations of Dutch neutrality into the menacing dark, across 
the gunwale of <em>Chill II</em> they found the body of the tow-headed 
youth whose business it had been not to die.</p>


<p>For the first hour, talking little, Davies and Wemple stumbled along 
the apology for a road that led through the jungle to the lodge. They did 
discuss the glares of several fires to the east along the south bank of 
Panuco River, and hoped fervently that they were dwellings and not 
wells.</p>

<p>"Two billion dollars worth of oil right here in the Ebaño field 
alone," Davies grumbled.</p>

<p>"And a drunken Mexican, whose whole carcass and immortal soul 
aren't worth ten pesos including hair, hide, and tallow, can start the bonfire 
with a lighted wad of cotton waste," was Wemple's contribution. "And if 
ever she starts, she'll gut the field of its last barrel."</p>

<p>Dawn, at five, enabled them to accelerate their pace; and six o'clock 
found them routing out the occupants of the lodge.</p>

<p>"Dress for rough travel, and don't stop for any frills," Wemple called 
around the corner of Miss Drexel's screened sleeping porch.</p>

<p>"Not a wash, nothing;" Davies supplemented grimly, as he shook 
hands with Charley Drexel, who yawned and slippered up to them in 
pajamas. "Where are those horses, Charley? Still alive?"</p>

<p>Wemple finished giving orders to the sleepy peons to remain and care 
for the place, occupying their spare time with hiding the more valuable 
things, and was calling around the corner to Miss Drexel the news of the 
capture of Vera Cruz, when Davies returned with the information that the 
horses consisted of a pair of moth-eaten skates that could be depended 
upon to lie down and die in the first half mile.</p>

<p>Beth Drexel emerged, first protesting that under no circumstances 
would she be guilty of riding the creatures, and, next, her brunette skin and 
dark eyes still flushed warm with sleep, greeting the two rescuers.</p>

<p>"It would be just as well if you washed your face, Stanton," she told 
Davies; and, to Wemple: "You're just as bad, Jim. You are a pair of dirty 
boys."</p>

<p>"And so will you be," Wemple assured her, "before you get back to 
Tampico. Are you ready?"</p>

<p>"As soon as Juanita packs my hand bag."</p>

<p>"Heavens, Beth, don't waste time!" exclaimed Wemple. "Jump in and 
grab up what you want."</p>

<p>"Make a start—make a start," chanted Davies. "Hustle! 
Hustle!—Charley, get the rifle you like best and take it along. Get a 
couple for us."</p>

<p>"Is it as serious as that?" Miss Drexel queried.</p>

<p>Both men nodded.</p>

<p>"The Mexicans are tearing loose," Davies explained. "How they 
missed this place I don't know." A movement in the adjoining room 
startled him. "Who's that?" he cried.</p>

<p>"Why, Mrs. Morgan," Miss Drexel answered.</p>

<p>"Good heavens, Wemple, I'd forgotten <em>her,"</em> groaned Davies. 
"How will we ever get her anywhere?"</p>

<p>"Let Beth walk, and relay the lady on the nags."</p>

<p>"She weighs a hundred and eighty," Miss Drexel laughed. "Oh, hurry, 
Martha! We're waiting on you to start!"</p>

<p>Muffled speech came through the partition, and then emerged a very 
short, stout, much-flustered woman of middle age.</p>

<p>"I simply can't walk, and you boys needn't demand it of me," was her 
plaint. "It's no use. I couldn't walk half a mile to save my life, and it's six 
of the worst miles to the river."</p>

<p>They regarded her in despair.</p>

<p>"Then you'll ride," said Davies. "Come on, Charley. We'll get a saddle 
on each of the nags."</p>

<p>Along the road through the tropic jungle, Miss Drexel and Juanita, her 
Indian maid, led the way. Her brother, carrying the three rifles, brought up 
the rear, while in the middle Davies and Wemple struggled with Mrs. 
Morgan and the two decrepit steeds. One, a flea-bitten roan, groaned 
continually from the moment Mrs. Morgan's burden was put upon him till 
she was shifted to the other horse. And this other, a mangy sorrel, 
invariably lay down at the end of a quarter of a mile of Mrs. Morgan.</p>

<p>Miss Drexel laughed and joked and encouraged; and Wemple, in 
brutal fashion, compelled Mrs. Morgan to walk every third quarter of a 
mile. At the end of an hour the sorrel refused positively to get up, and, so, 
was abandoned. Thereafter, Mrs. Morgan rode the roan alternate quarters 
of miles, and between times walked—if <em>walk</em> may describe 
her stumbling progress on two preposterously tiny feet with a man 
supporting her on either side.</p>

<p>A mile from the river, the road became more civilized, running along 
the side of a thousand acres of banana plantation.</p>

<p>"Parslow's," young Drexel said. "He'll lose a year's crop now on 
account of this mix-up."</p>

<p>"Oh, look what I've found!" Miss Drexel called from the lead.</p>

<p>"First machine that ever tackled this road," was young Drexel's 
judgment, as they halted to stare at the tire-tracks.</p>

<p>"But look at the tracks," his sister urged. "The machine must have 
come right out of the bananas and climbed the bank."</p>

<p>"Some machine to climb a bank like that," was Davies' comment. 
"What it did do was to go down the bank—take a scout after it, 
Charley, while Wemple and I get Mrs. Morgan off her fractious mount. 
No machine ever built could travel far through those bananas."</p>

<p>The flea-bitten roan, on its four legs up-standing, continued bravely to 
stand until the lady was removed, whereupon, with a long sigh, it sank 
down on the ground. Mrs. Morgan likewise sighed, sat down, and 
regarded her tiny feet mournfully.</p>

<p>"Go on, boys," she said. "Maybe you can find something at the river 
and send back for me."</p>

<p>But their indignant rejection of the plan never attained speech, for, at 
that instant, from the green sea of banana trees beneath them, came the 
sudden purr of an engine. A minute later the splutter of an exhaust told 
them the silencer had been taken off. The huge-fronded banana trees were 
violently agitated as by the threshing of a hidden Titan. They could 
identify the changing of gears and the reversing and going ahead, until, at 
the end of five minutes, a long low, black car burst from the wall of 
greenery and charged the soft earth bank, but the earth was too soft, and 
when, two-thirds of the way up, beaten, Charley Drexel braked the car to a 
standstill, the earth crumbled from under the tires, and he ran it down and 
back, the way he had come, until half-buried in the bananas.</p>

<p>"'A Merry Oldsmobile!"' Miss Drexel quoted from the popular song, 
clapping her hands. "Now, Martha, your troubles are over."</p>

<p>"Six-cylinder, and sounds as if it hadn't been out of the shop a week, 
or may I never ride in a machine again," Wemple remarked, looking to 
Davies for confirmation.</p>

<p>Davies nodded.</p>

<p>"It's Allison's," he said. "Campos tried to shake him down for a private 
loan, and—well, you know Allison. He told Campos to go to. And 
Campos, in revenge, commandeered his new car. That was two days ago, 
before we lifted a hand at Vera Cruz. Allison told me yesterday the last 
he'd heard of the car it was on a steamboat bound up river. And here's 
where they ditched it—but let's get a hustle on and get her into the 
running."</p>

<p>Three attempts they made, with young Drexel at the wheel; but the 
soft earth and the pitch of the grade baffled.</p>

<p>"She's got the power all right," young Drexel protested. "But she can't 
bite into that mush."</p>

<p>So far, they had spread on the ground the robes found in the car. The 
men now added their coats, and Wemple, for additional traction, 
unsaddled the roan, and spread the cinches, stirrup leathers, saddle 
blanket, and bridle in the way of the wheels. The car took the treacherous 
slope in a rush, with churning wheels biting into the woven fabrics; and, 
with no more than a hint of hesitation, it cleared the crest and swung into 
the road.</p>

<p>"Isn't she the spunky devil!" Drexel exulted. "Say, she could climb the 
side of a house if she could get traction."</p>

<p>"Better put on that silencer again, if you don't want to play tag with 
every soldier in the district," Wemple ordered, as they helped Mrs. 
Morgan in.</p>

<p>The road to the Dutch gusher compelled them to go through the 
outskirts of Panuco town. Indian and half breed women gazed stolidly at 
the strange vehicle, while the children and barking dogs clamorously 
advertised its progress. Once, passing long lines of tethered federal horses, 
they were challenged by a sentry; but at Wemple's "Throw on the juice!" 
the car took the rutted road at fifty miles an hour. A shot whistled after 
them. But it was not the shot that made Mrs. Morgan scream. The cause 
was a series of hog-wallows masked with mud, which nearly tore the 
steering wheel from Drexel's hands before he could reduce speed.</p>

<p>"Wonder it didn't break an axle," Davies growled. "Go on and take it 
easy, Charley. We're past any interference."</p>

<p>They swung into the Dutch camp and into the beginning of their real 
troubles. The refugee steamboat had departed down river from the 
Asphodel camp; <em>Chill II</em> had disappeared, the superintendent knew 
not how, along with the body of Peter Tonsburg; and the superintendent 
was dubious of their remaining.</p>

<p>"I've got to consider the owners," he told them. "This is the biggest 
well in Mexico, and you know it—a hundred and eighty-five 
thousand barrels daily flow. I've no right to risk it. We have no trouble 
with the Mexicans. It's you Americans. If you stay here, I'll have to protect 
you. And I can't protect you, anyway. We'll all lose our lives and they'll 
destroy the well in the bargain. And if they fire it, it means the entire 
Ebaño oil field. The strata's too broken. We're flowing twenty 
thousand barrels now, and we can't pinch down any further. As it is, the 
oil's coming up outside the pipe. And we can't have a fight. We've got to 
keep the oil moving."</p>

<p>The men nodded. It was cold-blooded logic; but there was no fault to 
it.</p>

<p>The harassed expression eased on the superintendent's face, and he 
almost beamed on them for agreeing with him.</p>

<p>"You've got a good machine there," he continued. "The ferry's at the 
bank at Panuco, and once you're across, the rebels aren't so thick on the 
north shore. Why, you can beat the steamboat back to Tampico by hours. 
And it hasn't rained for days. The road won't be at all bad."</p>

<p>"Which is all very good," Davies observed to Wemple as they 
approached Panuco, "except for the fact that the road on the other side was 
never built for automobiles, much less for a long-bodied one like this. I 
wish it were the Four instead of the Six."</p>

<p>"And it would bother you with a Four to negotiate that hill at Aliso 
where the road switchbacks above the river."</p>

<p>"And we're going to do it with a Six or lose a perfectly good Six in 
trying," Beth Drexel laughed to them.</p>

<p>Avoiding the cavalry camp, they entered Panuco with all the speed the 
ruts permitted, swinging dizzy corners to the squawking of chickens and 
barking of dogs. To gain the ferry, they had to pass down one side of the 
great plaza which was the heart of the city. Peon soldiers, drowsing in the 
sun or clustering around the <em>cantinas,</em> stared stupidly at them as 
they flashed past. Then a drunken major shouted a challenge from the 
doorway of a <em>cantina</em> and began vociferating orders, and as they 
left the plaza behind they could hear rising the familiar mob-cry <em>"Kill 
the Gringos!"</em></p>

<p>"If any shooting begins, you women get down in the bottom of the 
car," Davies commanded. "And there's the ferry all right. Be careful, 
Charley."</p>

<p>The machine plunged directly down the bank through a cut so deep 
that it was more like a chute, struck the gangplank with a terrific bump, 
and seemed fairly to leap on board. The ferry was scarcely longer than the 
machine, and Drexel, visibly shaken by the closeness of the shave, 
managed to stop only when six inches remained between the front wheels 
and overboard.</p>

<p>It was a cable ferry, operated by gasoline, and, while Wemple cast off 
the mooring lines, Davies was making swift acquaintance with the engine. 
The third turn-over started it, and he threw it into gear with the windlass 
that began winding up the cable from the river's bottom.</p>

<p>By the time they were in midstream a score of horsemen rode out on 
the bank they had just left and opened a scattering fire. The party crowded 
in the shelter of the car and listened to the occasional ricochet of a bullet. 
Once, only, the car was struck.</p>

<p>"Here!—what are you up to?" Wemple demanded suddenly of 
Drexel, who had exposed himself to fish a rifle out of the car.</p>

<p>"Going to show the skunks what shooting is," was his answer.</p>

<p>"No, you don t," Wemple said. "We're not here to fight, but to get this 
party to Tampico." He remembered Peter Tonsburg's remark. "Whose 
business is to live, Charley—that's our business. Anybody can get 
killed. It's too easy these days."</p>

<p>Still under fire, they moored at the north shore, and when Davies had 
tossed overboard the igniter from the ferry engine and commandeered ten 
gallons of its surplus gasoline, they took the steep, soft road up the bank in 
a rush.</p>

<p>"Look at her climb," Drexel uttered gleefully. "That Aliso hill won't 
bother us at all. She'll put a crimp in it, that's what she'll do."</p>

<p>"It isn't the hill, it's the sharp turn of the zig-zag that's liable to put a 
crimp in her," Davies answered. "That road was never laid out for autos, 
and no auto has ever been over it. They steamboated this one up."</p>

<p>But trouble came before Aliso was reached. Where the road dipped 
abruptly into a small jag of hollow that was almost V-shaped, it arose out 
and became a hundred yards of deep sand. In order to have speed left for 
the sand after he cleared the stiff up-grade of the V, Drexel was compelled 
to hit the trough of the V with speed. Wemple clutched Miss Drexel as she 
was on the verge of being bounced out. Mrs. Morgan, too solid for such 
airiness, screamed from the pain of the bump; and even the imperturbable 
Juanita fell to crossing herself and uttering prayers with exceeding 
rapidity.</p>

<p>The car cleared the crest and encountered the sand, going slower from 
moment to moment, slewing and writing and squirming from side to side. 
The men leaped out and began shoving. Miss Drexel urged Juanita out and 
followed. But the car came to a standstill, and Drexel, looking back and 
pointing, showed the first sign of being beaten. Two things he pointed to: 
a constitutional soldier on horseback a quarter of a mile in the rear; and a 
portion of the narrow road that had fallen out bodily on the far slope of the 
V.</p>

<p>"Can't get at this sand unless we go back and try over, and we ditch 
the car if we try to back up that."</p>

<p>The ditch was a huge natural sump-hole, the stagnant surface of which 
was a-crawl with slime twenty feet beneath.</p>

<p>Davies and Wemple sprang to take the boy's place.</p>

<p>"You can't do it," he urged. "You can get the back wheels past, but 
right there you hit that little curve, and if you make it your front wheel will 
be off the bank. If you don't make it, your back wheel'll be off."</p>

<p>Both men studied it carefully, then looked at each other.</p>

<p>"We've got to," said Davies.</p>

<p>"And we're going to," Wemple said, shoving his rival aside in 
comradely fashion and taking the post of danger at the wheel. "You're just 
as good as I at the wheel, Davies," he explained. "But you're a better shot. 
dour job's cut out to go back and hold off any Greasers that show up."</p>

<p>Davies took a rifle and strolled back with so ominous an air that the 
lone cavalryman put spurs to his horse and fled. Mrs. Morgan was helped 
out and sent plodding and tottering unaided on her way to the end of the 
sand stretch. Miss Drexel and Juanita joined Charley in spreading the 
coats and robes on the sand and in gathering and spreading small 
branches, brush, and armfuls of a dry, brittle shrub. But all three ceased 
from their exertions to watch Wemple as he shot the car backward down 
the V and up. The car seemed first to stand on one end, then on the other, 
and to reel drunkenly and to threaten to turn over into the sump-hole when 
its right front wheel fell into the air where the road had ceased to be. But 
the hind wheels bit and climbed the grade and out.</p>

<p>Without pause, gathering speed down the perilous slope, Wemple 
came ahead and up, gaining fifty feet of sand over the previous failure. 
More of the alluvial soil of the road had dropped out at the bad place; but 
he took the V in reverse, overhung the front wheel as before, and from the 
top came ahead again. Four times he did this, gaining each time, but each 
time knocking a bigger hole where the road fell out, until Miss Drexel 
begged him not to try again.</p>

<p>He pointed to a squad of horsemen coming at a gallop along the road a 
mile in the rear, and took the V once again in reverse.</p>

<p>"If only we had more stuff," Drexel groaned to his sister, as he threw 
down a meager, hard-gathered armful of the dry and brittle shrub, and as 
Wemple once more, with rush and roar, shot down the V.</p>

<p>For an instant it seemed that the great car would turn over into the 
sump, but the next instant it was past. It struck the bottom of the hollow a 
mighty wallop, and bounced and upended to the steep pitch of the climb. 
Miss Drexel, seized by inspiration or desperation, with a quick movement 
stripped off her short, corduroy tramping-skirt, and, looking very lithe and 
boyish in slender-cut pongee bloomers, ran along the sand and dropped the 
skirt for a foothold for the slowly revolving wheels. Almost, but not quite, 
did the car stop, then, gathering way, with the others running alongside 
and shoving, it emerged on the hard road.</p>

<p>While they tossed the robes and coats and Miss Drexel's skirt into the 
bottom of the car and got Mrs. Morgan on board, Davies overtook 
them.</p>

<p>"Down on the bottom!—all of you!" he shouted, as he gained the 
running board and the machine sprang away. A scattering of shots came 
from the rear.</p>

<p>"Whose business is to live!—hunch down!" Davies yelled in 
Wemple's ear, accompanying the instruction with an open-handed blow on 
the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Live yourself," Wemple grumbled as he obediently hunched. "Get 
your head down. You're exposing yourself."</p>

<p>The pursuit lasted but a little while, and died away in an occasional 
distant shot.</p>

<p>"They've quit," Davies announced. "It never entered their stupid heads 
that they could have caught us on Aliso Hill."</p>

<p>"It can't be done," was Charley Drexel's quick judgment of youth, as 
the machine stopped and they surveyed the acute-angled turn on the stiff 
up-grade of Aliso. Beneath was the swift-running river.</p>

<p>"Get out everybody!" Wemple commanded. "Up-side, all of you, if 
you don't want the car to turn over on you. Spread traction wherever she 
needs it."</p>

<p>"Shoot her ahead, or back—she can't stop," Davies said quietly, 
from the outer edge of the road, where he had taken position. "The earth's 
crumbling away from under the tires every second she stands still."</p>

<p>"Get out from under, or she'll be on top of you," Wemple ordered, as 
he went ahead several yards.</p>

<p>But again, after the car rested a minute, the light, dry earth began to 
crack and crumble away from under the tires, rolling in a miniature 
avalanche down the steep declivity into the water. And not until Wemple 
had backed fifty yards down the narrow road did he find solid resting for 
the car. He came ahead on foot and examined the acute angle formed by 
the two zig-zags. Together with Davies he planned what was to be 
done.</p>

<p>"When you come you've got to come a-humping," Davies advised. "If 
you stop anywhere for more than seconds, it's good night, and the walking 
won't be fine."</p>

<p>"She's full of fight, and she can do it. See that hard formation right 
there on the inside wall. It couldn't have come at a better spot. If I don't 
make her hind wheels climb half way up it, we'll start walking about a 
second thereafter."</p>

<p>"She's a two-fisted piece of machinery," Davies encouraged. "I know 
her kind. If she can't do it, no machine can that was ever made. Am I right, 
Beth?"</p>

<p>"She's a regular, spunky she-devil," Miss Drexel laughed agreement. 
"And so are the pair of you—er—of the male persuasion, I 
mean."</p>

<p>Miss Drexel had never seemed so fascinating to either of them as she 
was then, in the excitement quite unconscious of her abbreviated costume, 
her brown hair flying, her eyes sparkling, her lips smiling. Each man 
caught the other in that moment's pause to look, and each man sighed to 
the other and looked frankly into each other's eyes ere he turned to the 
work at hand.</p>

<p>Wemple came up with his usual rush, but it was a gauged rush; and 
Davies took the post of danger, the outside running board, where his 
weight would help the broad tires to bite a little deeper into the 
treacherous surface. If the road-edge crumbled away it was inevitable that 
he would be caught under the car as it rolled over and down to the 
river.</p>

<p>It was ahead and reverse, ahead and reverse, with only the briefest of 
pauses in which to shift the gears. Wemple backed up the hard formation 
on the inside bank till the car seemed standing on end, rushed ahead till 
the earth of the outer edge broke under the front tires and splashed in the 
water. Davies, now off, and again on the running board when needed, 
accompanied the car in its jerky and erratic progress, tossing robes and 
coats under the tires, calling instructions to Drexel similarly occupied on 
the other side, and warning Miss Drexel out of the way.</p>

<p>"Oh, you Merry Olds, you Merry Olds, you Merry Olds," Wemple 
muttered aloud, as if in prayer, as he wrestled the car about the narrow 
area, gaining sometimes inches in pivoting it, sometimes fetching back up 
the inner wall precisely at the spot previously attained, and, once, having 
the car, with the surface of the roadbed under it, slide bodily and sidewise, 
two feet down the road.</p>

<p>The clapping of Miss Drexel's hands was the first warning Davies 
received that the feat was accomplished, and, swinging on to the running 
board, he found the car backing in the straight-away up the next zigzag 
and Wemple still chanting ecstatically, "Oh, you Merry Olds, you Merry 
Olds!"</p>

<p>There were no more grades nor zig-zags between them and Tampico, 
but, so narrow was the primitive road, two miles farther were backed 
before space was found in which to turn around. One thing of importance 
did lie between them and Tampico—namely the investing lines of the 
constitutionalists. But here, at noon, fortune favored in the form of three 
American soldiers of fortune, operators of machine guns, who had fought 
the entire campaign with Villa from the beginning of the advance from the 
Texan border. Under a white flag, Wemple drove the car across the zone 
of debate into the federal lines, where good fortune, in the guise of an 
ubiquitous German naval officer, again received them.</p>

<p>"I think you are nearly the only Americans left in Tampico," he told 
them. "About all the rest are lying out in the Gulf on the different 
warships. But at the Southern Hotel there are several, and the situation 
seems quieter."</p>

<p>As they got out at the Southern, Davies laid this hand on the car and 
murmured, "Good old girl!" Wemple followed suit. And Miss Drexel, 
engaging both men's eyes and about to say something, was guilty of a 
sudden moisture in her own eyes that made her turn to the car with a 
caressing hand and repeat, "Good old girl!"</p>
